- (better) function composition with custom anonymous funtions to allow
things like avg etc. 
- better traces/ offsets in error reporting
- support floats (3.14159)

? verbose mode should also print the intermediate results of the evaluation process
? support fractions nicely (3/4)
? support e notation (1e6)
? support noob notation (1_000_0)
? macro support (now we're proper :D) hygenic?
? remove input source for tok from parsetree and replace with offset-len-span approach (especially with macro support when we generate subtrees)
? completion in readline editor would be cool
? lazy compute,eval (*) evalates default should be lazy (not eval)
? a proper/better execution env with simple bytecode (port to tinyVM, need go bindings)
? plotting :)
? concurrent eval of sublists, visiting (making it faster)
