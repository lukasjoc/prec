current: builtin readline/ editor support

todo: lexer should support floats and neg. numbers
todo: concurrent eval of sublists
todo: concurrent visiting
todo: remove input source for tok from parsetree and replace with offset-len-span approach
todo: functions/builtins with predefined prelude of functions like (sqrt, sin, cos, etc.)
todo: if adding functions/builtins completion in readline editor would be cool

maybe: make it turing complete (full lisp)
maybe: a proper/better execution env with simple bytecode
