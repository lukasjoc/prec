- lexer should support and neg. numbers
- lexer should support floats
- use a proper peaker
- remove input source for tok from parsetree and replace with offset-len-span approach
- functions/builtins with predefined prelude of functions like (sqrt, sin, cos, etc.)
- if adding functions/builtins completion in readline editor would be cool

? concurrent eval of sublists
? concurrent visiting
? make it turing complete (full lisp)
? a proper/better execution env with simple bytecode (port to tinyVM, need go bindings)
